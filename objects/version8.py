# 3. flee

#TODOS
              #CHARACTERS
#1. MAKE HERO DO DOUBLE DAMAGE WITH A PROBABLITY OF 20%
  #Using random module to generate percentage chance

#2. MAKE A NEW CHARACTER MEDIC WHO CAN RECUPERATE HEALTH AFTER BEING ATTACKED
#WITH A PROBABILITY OF 20%
   #use random.randint method to do this

#3 MAKE NEW CHARACTER SHADOW WHO HAS 1 HEALTH AND CAN ONLY TAKE DAMAGE
#  EVERY TENTH TIME
  #use counter variable to determine how many times shadow has been attacked,
  #if counter variable is equal ten he takes damage, counter variable is reset to 0 if 
  #he survives the attack

#4 MAKE A ZOMBIE CHARACTER WHO CANNOT BE KILLED EVEN IF HIS HEALTH IS BELOW 0
  #ZOMBIE CHARACTER HEALTH RETURN TRUE EVEN IF HEALTH IS LESS THAN 0

#5 MAKE TWO UNIQUE CHARACTERS AND IMPLEMENT THEM
  #ANTI-HERO - ANDY'S IDEA
  #RANDOM GUARADIAN ANGEL - CHRISTIAN'S IDEA

#6 MAKE CHARACTES GOBLIN PRIZE WOULD BE EQUAL TO 5, WIZARD TO 6
  #INVENTORY ATTRITUBE WITH PROPERTIES INCLUDING PURSE ATTRIBUTE WHICH WOULD CONTAIN COINS
  #IF ALIVE METHOD RETURNS FALSE ENEMY GETS THE VALUE OF CHARACTER'S PURSE


              #ITEMS

  #MAKE USE ITEM FUNCTION
    #IF ITEM QUANITY IS GREATER THAN 0
      #USE ITEM FUNCTION TAKE EFFECT
      #BREAK
    #ELIF THEY GO BACK
      #IT TAKES THEM BACK OUT TO MAIN MENU
      #PRINT YOU WASTED YOUR TURN
